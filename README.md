PS4 Exploit Host (Dockorized)
================

## What is this?
This is an easy way for anyone to host their own exploit for the PS4 on their LAN. Features include:
- Hosts your choice of exploit
- Allows caching of exploits for offline use
- Sends your choice of payload after a successful exploit
- Blocks PSN domains from resolving (Stops accidental updates and block telemetry)
- Serves a specific firmware update to your PS4
- Works on just about every platform
- Static Website builder, to run on HTTP server of your choice (You lose some features using this method, DNS, updater, etc)


## How to download
    `git clone --recursive https://github.com/rakanbakir/ps4-exploit-host-docker.git`

## Using remote DNS (Run Nothing Locally)
0. Make sure the PS4 is on firmware 7.55 or lower (`Settings > System > System Information`).
    - If your firmware version is >7.55 you are out of luck there is no public exploit available and you cannot downgrade.
1. On your PS4 go to `Settings > Network > Setup Network` to setup a network. When you get to DNS Settings select `Manual` and set the Primary to `165.227.83.145` and the Secondary DNS to `192.241.221.79` or visa-versa.
    - If your firmware version is <7.55 you will get a network update available. This is for 7.55.
    - **If you already have an official updated above 7.55 downloaded you must delete it first.**
2. On the PS4, go to `Settings > User's Guide` and select it. The exploit selection should appear.
    - You can also open browser and the default homepage will be the exploit selection.
3. If you use `Bin Loader` you will need to use another program to send a payload.

## How to run (Run Locally)
1. Download the files (As shown in the "How to download" section above)
2. `docker run -p80:80 -p53:53 rakanbakir/ps4-exploit-host-docker:7.5x`
3. On your PS4 `Settings > Network > Setup Network` to setup a network. When you get to DNS Settings select `Manual` and set the Primary and Secondary DNS to the IP address you noted above.
4. Make sure the PS4 is on a firmware version <=7.55 (`Settings > System > System Information`).
    - If your firmware version is >7.55 you are out of luck there is no public exploit available and you cannot downgrade.
5. On the PS4, go to `Settings > User's Guide` and select it. The exploit should run and there should be output on the script window. (Alternatively you can just open the Browser)
6. If applicable for your chosen exploit, the script will prompt you to choose a payload to send. You may send any payload located in the `payloads` folder.
7. When done use `Ctrl+C` to cleanly close the application

## About offline caching
- Redirect/Theme info is cached automatically
- Redirect/Theme info updates and refreshes automatically
- Exploits can be cached on a per firmware basis or all cached at once with the dropdown menu and/or `[Cache All]` button on the exploit selection menu.
- Exploit updates must be "manually" updated by clicking cache button an update is available or checking the "About" option in the exploit's dropdown menu.
    - You will be told if there is no update when clicking the button.
- If you are offline the caching buttons will be hidden as will exploits that require a network connection or are not cached

## About autoload
- Exploits can be automatically selected by clicking "Autoload" in the exploits dropdown menu
- When you open the browser it'll automatically select that exploit
- This can be disabled by clearing your browsers cookies
